# CurioHub

CurioHub is an open-source, community-curated discovery platform dedicated to finding and sharing the internet's most inspiring, educational, and mentally enriching content.

We filter the noise to find the signal. No clickbait, no outrage-farming‚Äîjust high-quality content that helps you grow.

## üöÄ The Vision

The internet is flooded with low-quality, addictive content. Yet, it's also home to incredible creators, thinkers, and artists producing life-changing work (like Andrew Huberman, Lex Fridman, and countless inspiring editors). The problem? This signal is buried in the noise.

CurioHub aims to solve this. It's a platform built and curated by a community that values growth, curiosity, and inspiration. It's the place you go to find content that leaves you better than you were before.

## ‚ú® Key Features (MVP)

- **Content Submission:** Users can submit links from approved sources (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, Reddit, X, articles).  
- **Community Curation:** Submissions don't go live immediately. They enter a "Discovery" queue where community members can upvote them.  
- **The "Elevate" Feed:** The main feed featuring the best, most-voted-on content.  
- **Source Filtering:** Browse content specifically from YouTube, Instagram, etc.  
- **Tagging & Categories:** A simple, powerful tagging system for topics like:  
  - science  
  - discipline  
  - running  
  - philosophy  
  - art  
  - tech  
  - mental-health  
- **User Profiles:** Simple profiles to save (bookmark) inspiring content to a personal "Library."

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Roadmap (The Dream)

- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** "If you loved this podcast on neuroscience, you might appreciate this deep-dive article on 'flow states'."  
- **"Journeys" / Collections:** Curated playlists of content. (e.g., "A 7-Day Journey into Stoic Philosophy").  
- **Creator Spotlights:** Feature high-quality, lesser-known creators.  
- **Browser Extension:** Easily submit content from anywhere on the web.  
- **Mobile App:** A native experience for iOS and Android.

## üíª Suggested Tech Stack

This is a suggestion to get the project started quickly and scalably.

- **Frontend:** Next.js (React framework) for performance, SEO, and a great developer experience.  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first UI development.  
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui for accessible, composable, and beautiful components.  
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase (or Firebase) as an open-source backend-as-a-service. It provides a Postgres database, authentication, storage, and real-time capabilities out of the box, letting us focus on the features.  
- **Deployment:** Vercel (for Next.js) or Netlify.
